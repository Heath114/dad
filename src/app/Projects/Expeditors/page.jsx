        This project took place at the Expeditors head office factories in Sahab, covering more than 2,900 mÂ². The scope included flooring traffic lining coatings, solo coatings, renovation and maintenance. Each step was carried out after a thorough inspection to ensure the solutions could withstand the factory's weather conditions and humidity levels. All work was completed with minimal disruption to the client's operations.

        This project involved the development of a comprehensive logistics solution for Expeditors, aimed at optimizing their supply chain operations. To ensure durability under constant industrial use, we prepared the substrates meticulously and selected coating systems that could withstand humidity and temperature fluctuations. Joints and lining paths were aligned precisely to maintain consistency across the factory floor, delivering both long-term performance and a clean, uniform finish.
